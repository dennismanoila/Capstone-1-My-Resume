                I am at the beggining of my Web Development journey,

                page aims to let you know more about me while I am
                putting in practice all the thing I've learned about
                HTML so far!<br/>

                            some history about Computer Science, developed my analytical thinking

        <li><h2>Work experience</h2></li>
            <p>
                I have zero experience in any IT related field since I've just got
                in University. My only experience comes from a marketing job where 
                I had to sell a course of Romanian Language to 12th grade pupils.
            </p>



        <li><h2>Skills</h2></li>
            <p>
                My IT related skills are: knowing how to write code in C++, C and 
                Python, and analytical thinking. My positive aspect is that I 
                usually get ideas that help me perform my task until its end.
            </p>


        <li><h2>Awards</h2></li>
            <p>
                Looking forward to gain some in the future.
                Right now I am focused on learning and after that we can
                easily remove the 'L'. :D
