                I had been playing football for 10 years before I started
                University. I used to play for <a href="https://www.uta-arad.ro/">
                UTA Arad</a>, a football club from my hometown, Arad. Now I only
                play once in a while, as a hobby.

            <p>
                I enjoy skiing so much despite the fact that, during most of my
                childhood, I was not able to do this since the winter breaks were
                for hard trainings with the football team for the upcoming matches.
                Now, there are no more strict training schedules so I afford to go
                skiing in winter. The image above is taken at
                <a href="https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muntele_Mic">Muntele Mic</a>,
                in Romania.
